I was looking for links to all the State Geological Surveys and found the Association of American State Geologists (AASG) [Homepage](http://www.stategeologists.org/) to have exactly what I needed.

I hope to build some sort of inventory of data samples available.Â  If I do one a day, can be done in 10 weeks, or about 3 months.

What I will find the most useful is data distribution methods and data structures.

The USGS has a sample web application and it includes statewide data for four states&#8211;Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, so those, along with Illinois and the states that border Minnesota will be among the first I take a look at.
