Took a quick look at the [North Dakota Geological Survey&#8217;s website](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/) for GIS data.

The only data I found served directly from their website was [surface geology map](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/surfacegeo/surfacemapsnew.asp) .pdfs for some 24k and 100k maps.  Also available is a search for [Oil & Gas wells](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/findwellsvw.asp) although I did not see the data was downloadable.  Some other [publications](https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/Publication_List/contentsnew.asp) have .pdfs that can be downloaded.

The [North Dakota Hub Explorer](http://web.apps.state.nd.us/imf/sites/hubexplorer/jsp/index.jsp) serves as the state&#8217;s official data portal including for GIS data.  The downloadable data includes bedrock geology, surface geology, and contours.  Interestingly, the site allows you to choose from 7 different coordinate systems and 27 different file formats including several AutoCad, ESRI, MapInfo, and KML.  The data I looked at had more attribution than the bare minimum shown on a hard-copy map.  Bedrock data, for example, had additional lithology.

Even though I appeared to be getting a _Request is complex_ error message, their system functioned very well, you step your way through a few selections and a few minutes later you receive an email providing a link to start a download of your compressed data.
