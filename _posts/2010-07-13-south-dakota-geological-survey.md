The [South Dakota Geological Survey](http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/) website provides some good base data&#8211;imagery, DRGs, DEMs, and DLGs.  There is a searchable database of [core cuttings](http://www.sddenr.net/core/) and the [state data server](http://arcgis.sd.gov/server/sdgis/Data.aspx) has bedrock data for the eastern portion of the state and a statewide layer, presumably surficial geology, called geology.  Quad-based geological maps are also available (PDF format) in the [Publications and Maps](http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/publications/index.html) section.  The data I downloaded was in shapefile format with minimal attribution.
