Ok, maybe I have been hiding under a rock, but just saw this is a post from [James Fee&#8217;s Spatially Adjusted blog](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/).  ESRI has a public suggestion box called  [ArcGIS Ideas](http://ideas.arcgis.com/) where users can submit suggestions for ESRI.  One thing I like is that it is open for other users to see and comment.  Not sure how responsive ESRI will be but at least it gives us a place to vent.
