The [Iowa Geological Survey](http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/) has a lot of data available to download [here](http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/webapps/nrgislibx/).  PDF versions of many of their publications can be found in their [List of Publications](http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/webapps/gsbpubs/).

Their GIS data is minimally attributed for the most part, their public wells data set did have a more robust attribution scheme.  One cool feature I found in the wells data is that they provide a hyper-link for many features to an [on-line site record](http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/webapps/geosam/Scripts/geocard.asp?wnumber=43873).  Found both shapefiles and file geodatabases in the samples I downloaded.

More interestingly, I opened up their Bedrock Geological Map and noticed something odd to me.  See the bulls-eye just NW of center?  That, even to a non-geologist like me, does not look too geologic.

Turns out it is related to a meteorite impact known as the [Manson Crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manson_crater), once thought to be The Dinosaur Killer until it was determined to be too old.
