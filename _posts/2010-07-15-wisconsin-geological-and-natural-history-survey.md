The [Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey](http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/) has a well organized, appealing website.  Their data is easy to find although there is not much GIS data available.

Although because I am more interested in sample data sets than anything, the [GIS data](http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/gis.htm) they do have&#8211;statewide geologic map; pleistocene geology, precambrian geology, quaternary geology, (surficial?) geology and bedrock geology for various counties&#8211;may actually be a great reference.  Other than the statewide geologic map, the data is available on a per-publication basis.

Some other data is available in the [open-file reports](http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/wofrs.htm).

They also have a [well contructor&#8217;s reports CD](http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/wcrs.htm) available for purchase, albeit only scanned images of the wells and a very simple database.

Other .pdfs are also available of various [state-wide maps](http://www.uwex.edu/wgnhs/sample.htm) and for various open-file reports.

I found some interesting things while reviewing the data I downloaded.

  1. There is minimal attribution on the data&#8211;enough to symbolize it.
  2. Dip & Strike triangles are captured as points with attribution of the horizontal azimuth and inclination.
  3. One item I found odd at first but quickly grew to appreciate is that they provide a georeferenced .sid of  each plate.  This allows you to directly compare the digital data to the final cartographic product.  Think this may be a keeper of an idea.
