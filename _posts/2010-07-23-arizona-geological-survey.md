[The Arizona Geological Survey](http://www.azgs.az.gov/) has a great looking site with some good information.  They have a [publication list](http://www.azgs.az.gov/publications_online/pubslist_2008.pdf) that can either be downloaded or ordered and are making pdf versions of their recent publications available [online](http://www.azgs.az.gov/publications_online.shtml).

I was going to note that there was no download-able data available until Google told me that they in fact had a [WMS/WFS available online](http://www.azgs.az.gov/services_azgeomap.shtml).  The WMS is a great looking map, I have not gotten the WFS to work, however&#8211;probably more due to my abilities than the service.

They are also temporarily hosting a [surficial geology map](http://services.azgs.az.gov/OnlineMaps/demos/nvClarkCounty.html) of Clark County, Nevada.

Lee Allison, the State Geologist, also has a [blog](http://arizonageology.blogspot.com/) with frequent postings.  One of which led me to the Nation Park Service&#8217;s [Data Stor](http://science.nature.nps.gov/nrdata/)e which is worth a look.
