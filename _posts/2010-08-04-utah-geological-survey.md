The [Utah Geological Survey](http://geology.utah.gov/) has a good supply of [Maps](http://geology.utah.gov/maps/geomap/index.htm) and [data](http://geology.utah.gov/maps/gis/index.htm) available online and some [online maps](http://geology.utah.gov/maps/index.htm). They also have an online [Blog](http://geology.utah.gov/blog/).

The GIS data is a fairly complete package&#8211;the sample I downloaded included .pdfs, shapefiles, layer files, images and ArcMap project (.MXD) files used to generate the .pdfs.  File sizes are larger because of the completeness.  Feature classes have a moderate level of attribution.

The highlight, however, are the sample [Keyhole Markup (KMZ) files](http://geology.utah.gov/geo_guides/st_george/index.htm) of the of the St. George 30&#8242; x 60&#8242; quadrangle that can be viewed in Google Earth.  Too cool.
