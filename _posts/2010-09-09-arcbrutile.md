Stumbled across [ArcBruTile](http://arcbrutile.codeplex.com/), an ArcMap application that allows you to display map tile services&#8211;such as [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/), [Bing](http://www.bing.com/maps/), [Spatial Cloud](http://www.spatialcloud.com/), and [Tile Map Service](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification) (TMS)&#8211;in your ArcMap documents.   It works pretty well from my preliminary testing of it.   I have found that at times that the graphical tiles are distorted but I am guessing it is because they are optimized for display in a specific projection, at specific scales and, in ArcMap, you can use any projection/scale combination you want.

This is a free, open-source project that is still in Beta but definitely an application I plan to keep an eye on.  As with any open-source project, the cool thing is the code is available for you to look at, learn from, and hopefully contribute to.
