Sometimes it seems like I could write the data down by long hand faster than ArcMap can copy & paste features from one feature class to another. geeeeezzz.

<div id="geo-post-226" class="geo geo-post" style="display: none">
  <span class="latitude">44.852994</span><span class="longitude">-93.55073</span>
