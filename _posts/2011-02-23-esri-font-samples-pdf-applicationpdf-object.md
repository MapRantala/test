Whenever I want to skim through ESRI&#8217;s fonts to find some symbology I need for a specific purpose, I go through some laborious process to skim the fonts searching for an adequate symbol.

However, in the [ESRI Mapping Center blog post,](http://blogs.esri.com/Support/blogs/mappingcenter/archive/2010/04/05/About-Fonts-in-ArcMap-Symbols.aspx) user [use2b311](http://blogs.esri.com/Support/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=24410) post a link to a pre-made pdf showing [ESRI Font Samples.pdf (application/pdf Object)](http://maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ESRI-Font-Samples.pdf).

Back when ESRI use to actually print hard-copy manuals, there were similar diagrams available but either I haven&#8217;t searched enough of they don&#8217;t exist in the digital help systems so I was happy to stumble upon this.

A tangent discovery in checking this out was [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/features), a free (with 2 Gig limit) online file sharing/online backup site&#8211;something I&#8217;ve had a need for but haven&#8217;t gotten around to researching. I have not tried them but may, just to see how well it works.
