Someone mentioned an idea on ArcIdeas for making various display settings on a feature classes scale-dependent.  Right now some of that can be accomplished by loading a feature classes multiple times, adjusting the settings, and setting the visible range.  Working more and more in ArcGIS Server, I can see the value of increased scale-dependent settings.

I&#8217;m not sure how rapidly ESRI takes &#8220;Ideas&#8221; into consideration but if you feel like it would benefit you, why not promote this idea:  [Scale Range, SQL Query and Symbology Rendering in ArcMap](http://ideas.arcgis.com/ideaView?id=087300000008IPaAAM).

Have a good weekend, all!
