When I first found out about GIS, the first application that came to mind was using it to map my running routes. At that time, I was using paper maps and scraps of paper to measure how far I was running each day. GIS obviously offered a better method.

Almost twenty years later, GPS has become so common place that I think we have four or five devices in our household that have GPS capabilities and measuring my runs has become ridiculously simple.

Given that background, you can understand why I love projects like <a href="http://barsukov.net/endomondo.html" target="_blank">this project</a> by Nikita Barsukov, who compiled publicly available data from <a href="http://www.endomondo.com" target="_blank">Endomondo</a> and created maps of public running workout tracks for a variety of European Cities, including this sample from Helsinki.<figure id="attachment_874" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-874" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Flowing Data, using a similar concept, generated <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/" target="_blank">similar maps</a> for several cities in the United States, including <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/#jp-carousel-33732" target="_blank">Minneapolis</a>&#8211;some areas I know.<figure id="attachment_877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-877" style="width: 214px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I&#8217;ve got about six years of running data of my own that I should use to generate a personal running route map but would be a fun project.
