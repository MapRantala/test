Obviously Cartographers belong in the same category as other superheroes&nbsp;like Superman, Batman, and Spiderman and we finally have a our own comic book to prove it.

<a href="http://cartozia.com" target="_blank"><em>Cartozia Tales</em></a> is a collaborative effort of nine indy artists with two guest artist each issue.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-882" alt="Cartozia" src="https://i2.wp.com/maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cartozia-234x300.png?resize=234%2C300" width="234" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i1.wp.com/maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cartozia.png)

They have an interesting plan, they&#8217;ve split the world into nine regions (what&#8217;s the name for the ninth of an area, nona-rant?) and the artist will tell a story from a different region each issue. They may build off the region&#8217;s story from the previous issue, continue on the story they told the previous issue, and start something fresh.

After being funded by a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1765342446/cartozia-tales-ten-issues?ref=live" target="_blank">KickStarter campaign</a>, they&#8217;ve shipped three issues already and have at least seven more promised. Think the project definitely deserve&#8217;s a look.
